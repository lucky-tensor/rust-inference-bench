}

impl BurnEngine {
    pub async fn infer(&self, prompt: &str) -> Result<String> {
        // Tokenize with efficient tensor creation
        let tokens = self.tokenizer.encode(prompt, false)?;
        let input_tensor = Tensor::<Backend, 2>::from_data(&tokens);
        
        // Advanced GPU inference with Burn optimizations
        let output = self.model.forward(input_tensor);
        
        // Decode with optimized operations
        self.decode_optimized(&output).await
